# Abundance estimation and DE


The scripts in this repo were used to perform abundance estimation and differential expression analysis of the cuttlefish RNA-seq reads

# Programs used 
* [Trinity](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq) - de novo assembler and contains helper scripts to run DE
* [RSEM](https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM) - used to perform transcript abundance estimation
* [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) - R Biocunductor Package used to perform and visualise DE analysis
